# Automations

Automations allow you to create custom bot behaviors through events.

## Scripting Language

Overseer uses a scripting language embedded in YAML called [YAMLCord][YAMLCordDocsURL] to create the automations.

## Automation Structure

```yml
sequences: # Sequences are the main building blocks of an automation
```
